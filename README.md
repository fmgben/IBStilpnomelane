This repository is related to the calculation of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_mineralogy' target='_blank'> Normative mineralogy</a>

Both a simple direct calculation of mineralogy is provided an additional step to optimise the mineralogy is provided as well.
Using the normative mineralogical calculation as constraints and starting concentrations.

This code has been structured for simple configuration and deployment.

Configuration is via .csv files.
Deployment is with pip

Definition of minerals is by passing a chemical formula and the code will convert to elemental concentratations.
